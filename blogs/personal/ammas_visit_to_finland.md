### Day 1
I was not able to visit there.

### Day 2
Just before noon, I gave a call to the contact number given in the website and found that, they have been issuing tokens for the early arrivals which I was not aware of. By the time I reached there, they have given away all the tokens and I was left with only time-cards. 

Time-cards are those converted to tokens soon after darshan tokens are completed. This is just to give some priority for the late comers in chronological order.

### Darshan and embracing
After some waiting, we were given an opportunity to enter into the darshan queue. I was asked to kneel down infront and Amma embraced me with her both hands and said some sacred words on my ears (I am not going to say that here). That was such a divine feeling. This cannot be expressed in words. One must feel it to enjoy it :) I was immediately asked to move giving opportunity for other divotees. But it took me some hours to get back from the bliss.
